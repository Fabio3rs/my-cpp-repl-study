**Alpha Release**: Interactive C++ development through dynamic compilation and crash-safe execution

**Current Features**: Dynamic compilation • Signal-to-exception translation • Parallel compilation pipeline • Simple autocompletion • Real-time function replacement • Assembly-level debugging • AST analysis

---

## Abstract

This project presents a **C++ REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) v1.5-alpha** - an interactive programming environment where users can write, test, and execute C++ code line by line, similar to Python's interactive shell. Unlike existing solutions like clang-repl that interpret code through virtual machines, this implementation compiles each input directly to native machine code with optimizations.

**Core Architecture (v1.5-alpha)**: The system employs a **parallel compilation pipeline** that:
1. **Compiles user input** into native executable code (shared libraries) using multi-core processing
2. **Analyzes code semantically** through AST parsing for basic completion
3. **Loads code dynamically** using the operating system's library loading mechanisms  
4. **Handles crashes gracefully** by converting hardware signals into manageable C++ exceptions
5. **Provides comprehensive debugging** with automatic crash analysis and assembly-level introspection

**Performance Achievements (Measured in Ubuntu 24.04)**:
- **Fast compilation** (80-95ms average) through optimized parallel pipeline and LLVM linker
- **Simple completion** with basic symbol and keyword matching
- **0.8s startup time** with intelligent caching systems
- **150MB peak memory usage** during complex compilations
- **Linear scaling** with available CPU cores for multi-file processing

**Alpha Status**: With **7,500+ lines** of tested code and **13/14 tests passing (92.8% success rate)**, the system demonstrates stable core functionality while some advanced features remain in development for v2.0.

## Introduction and Motivation

The initial concept emerged from exploring the feasibility of compiling code from standard input as a library and loading it via `dlopen` to execute its functions. Upon demonstrating this approach's viability, the research evolved toward developing a more streamlined method for extracting symbols and their types from compiled code, leveraging Clang's AST-dump JSON output capabilities.

## Core Architecture and Techniques

### 1. Advanced Signal Handling and Exception Translation

A sophisticated signal handling system converts hardware exceptions into C++ exceptions:

#### Signal-to-Exception Architecture:

```cpp
namespace segvcatch {
    struct hardware_exception_info {
        int signo;
        void *addr;
    };

    class hardware_exception : public std::runtime_error {
        public:
            hardware_exception_info info;
    };

    class segmentation_fault : public hardware_exception;
    class floating_point_error : public hardware_exception;
    class interrupted_by_the_user : public hardware_exception;
}
```

**Key Features:**
- **Signal Interception**: Converts SIGSEGV, SIGFPE, and SIGINT into typed C++ exceptions
- **Address Preservation**: Maintains fault addresses for debugging purposes
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Prevents REPL crashes from user code errors
- **Typed Exception Hierarchy**: Provides specific exception types for different hardware faults

#### Custom Exception Memory Management:

The system implements a novel approach to exception backtrace capture by intercepting the C++ exception allocation mechanism:

```cpp
extern "C" void *__cxa_allocate_exception(size_t size) noexcept {
    std::array<void *, 1024> exceptionsbt{};
    int bt_size = backtrace(exceptionsbt.data(), exceptionsbt.size());

    // Embed backtrace directly in exception memory layout
    size_t nsize = (size + 0xFULL) & (~0xFULL);  // 16-byte alignment
    nsize += sizeof(uintptr_t) + sizeof(uintptr_t) + sizeof(size_t);
    nsize += sizeof(void *) * bt_size;

    void *ptr = cxa_allocate_exception_o(nsize);
    // Embed magic number and backtrace data
}
```

**Technical Innovations:**
- **ABI Interception**: Hooks into `__cxa_allocate_exception` to capture stack traces
- **Memory Layout Management**: Embeds backtrace data within exception objects using careful alignment
- **Magic Number System**: Uses `0xFADED0DEBAC57ACELL` for reliable backtrace identification
- **Zero-Overhead Integration**: Backtrace capture occurs during exception allocation without runtime overhead

### 2. Assembly-Level Debugging and Introspection

Advanced debugging capabilities provide detailed crash analysis:

```cpp
namespace assembly_info {
    std::string analyzeAddress(const std::string &binaryPath, uintptr_t address);
    std::string getInstructionAndSource(pid_t pid, uintptr_t address);
}
```

**Capabilities:**
- **Instruction Disassembly**: Uses GDB integration to disassemble crash addresses
- **Source Line Mapping**: Employs `addr2line` for crash-to-source correlation
- **Memory Layout Analysis**: Examines maps for memory segment information
- **Real-time Debugging**: Provides immediate crash analysis without external debuggers

### 3. Dynamic Compilation Strategy

The system employs a **compile-then-link** approach rather than interpretation:

- **Source-to-Shared-Library Pipeline**: Each user input is wrapped in C++ code and compiled into position-independent shared libraries (.so files) using Clang/GCC with `-shared -fPIC` flags
- **Precompiled Headers**: Uses precompiled headers (precompiledheader.hpp.pch) to accelerate compilation times and reduce AST dump file sizes
- **Parallel Compilation Architecture**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** - Optimized dual-level parallelization
  - **Inter-file Parallelism**: Multiple source files compiled simultaneously
  - **Intra-file Parallelism**: AST analysis and object compilation run in parallel using `std::async`
  - **Multi-core Scaling**: Linear performance scaling with available CPU cores
  - **Thread Configuration**: Auto-detects `hardware_concurrency()` with configurable thread limits

**Performance Results:**
- **Single File Compilation**: **93ms average** (measured in Ubuntu 24.04 environment)
- **Multi-file Projects**: Linear scaling with number of CPU cores
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Full backward compatibility maintained

Example compilation command:
```cpp
auto cmd = compiler + " -std=" + std + " -fPIC -Xclang -ast-dump=json " +
           includePrecompiledHeader + getIncludeDirectoriesStr() + " " +
           getPreprocessorDefinitionsStr() + " -fsyntax-only " + name + ext +
           " -o lib" + name + ".so > " + name + ".json";
```

### 4. Simple Completion System (v1.5-alpha)

The current version implements **basic readline-based completion** with plans for advanced LSP integration in v2.0:

#### Current Completion (Working):
```cpp
namespace completion {
    class SimpleReadlineCompletion {
        // Basic symbol and keyword completion
        std::vector<std::string> getBasicCompletions(const std::string& text);
        void setupReadlineCompletion();
        
        // Simple completion matching
        bool matchesPrefix(const std::string& symbol, const std::string& prefix);
    };
}
```

**Current Features (v1.5-alpha):**
- ✅ **Keyword completion**: C++20 keywords and standard library symbols
- ✅ **Basic symbol matching**: Simple string-based completion
- ✅ **Readline integration**: Standard readline completion interface

#### 🚧 **Future LSP Integration (v2.0 Target):**

Advanced clangd-based completion is architecturally prepared but not yet implemented:

```cpp
// TODO: Complete implementation for v2.0
namespace completion {
    class LspClangdService {
        // LSP client with full JSON-RPC protocol support
        bool start(const std::string& clangdPath);          // TODO: Implement
        std::vector<CompletionItem> getCompletions(...);    // TODO: Implement
        
        // Event loop with timeout handling
        bool pumpUntil(std::function<bool(const json&)>...; // TODO: Implement
    };

    class LspReadlineIntegration {
        // RAII scope management for REPL integration
        struct Scope {
            void updateReplContext(const ReplState& repl);   // TODO: Implement
            std::vector<CompletionItem> complete(...);       // TODO: Implement
        };
    };
}
```

**Planned Features (v2.0):**
- 🚧 **Context-aware completion**: Semantic understanding of current scope
- 🚧 **Error diagnostics**: Real-time syntax and semantic error highlighting  
- 🚧 **Intelligent suggestions**: Function signatures, member completion
- 🚧 **Performance target**: Sub-100ms completion latency with background processing

**Architecture Benefits (Ready for v2.0):**
- ✅ **Stable Interface**: JSON-RPC LSP protocol (version-independent)
- ✅ **Isolation**: Separate clangd process prevents REPL crashes
- ✅ **Scalability**: Foundation for large codebase handling

### 5. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Analysis and Export

A sophisticated AST analysis system extracts symbol information while addressing the challenges of global scope execution:

- **Clang AST Export**: Utilizes Clang's `-Xclang -ast-dump=json` functionality to export complete AST information in JSON format
- **Symbol Extraction**: Parses AST to identify function declarations (`FunctionDecl`), variable declarations (`VarDecl`), and C++ method declarations (`CXXMethodDecl`)
- **Mangled Name Resolution**: Extracts both demangled and mangled symbol names for proper linking
- **Type Information Preservation**: Maintains complete type qualifiers and storage class information
- **Header Optimization**: Precompiled headers significantly reduce AST dump file sizes by excluding unnecessary header content

### 5. Global Scope Challenges and Solutions

Unlike conventional REPL behavior that permits code and declarations in any sequence, C++ global scope execution presents unique challenges:

- **Function Execution Problem**: Invoking functions within global scope without variable assignment proved cumbersome
- **Direct Declarations Support**: Global variable and function declarations work directly without special commands
- **#eval Command Innovation**: Introduced specifically for expressions that need to be executed (not for declarations)
- **File Integration**: Extended `#eval` to accept filenames, incorporating file contents for compilation
- **Automatic Function Invocation**: If compiled code contains a function named `_Z4execv`, it's automatically executed

### 6. Dynamic Linking and Symbol Resolution

The system implements advanced dynamic linking techniques using POSIX APIs:

- **Runtime Library Loading**: Uses `dlopen()` with `RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL` flags for immediate symbol resolution and global symbol availability
- **Symbol Address Calculation**: Implements memory mapping analysis through maps to calculate actual symbol addresses in virtual memory
- **Offset-Based Resolution**: Calculates symbol offsets within shared libraries using `nm` command parsing
- **First-Symbol Priority**: Leverages `dlsym`'s behavior of returning the first encountered symbol occurrence

### 7. Function Wrapper Generation and Dynamic Replacement

A novel approach to handle forward declarations and enable real-time function replacement:

#### Function Wrapper Architecture:
```cpp
extern "C" void *foo_ptr = nullptr;

void __attribute__((naked)) foo() {
    __asm__ __volatile__ (
        "jmp *%0\n"
        :
        : "r" (foo_ptr)
    );
}
```

- **Naked Function Wrappers**: Generates assembly-level function wrappers using `__attribute__((naked))` to create trampolines
- **Lazy Symbol Resolution**: Implements deferred symbol loading where function calls are initially directed to resolver functions
- **Dynamic Function Replacement**: Enables hot-swapping of function implementations without unloading old code
- **Assembly-Level Interception**: Uses inline assembly to preserve register state during symbol resolution

### 8. Error Recovery and Debugging Integration

The system provides comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities:

#### Exception Handling in REPL Loop:
```cpp
try {
    execv();  // Execute user code
} catch (const segvcatch::hardware_exception &e) {
    std::cerr << "Hardware exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    std::cerr << assembly_info::getInstructionAndSource(getpid(),
        reinterpret_cast<uintptr_t>(e.info.addr)) << std::endl;

    auto [btrace, size] = backtraced_exceptions::get_backtrace_for(e);
    if (btrace != nullptr && size > 0) {
        backtrace_symbols_fd(btrace, size, 2);
    }
}
```

**Features:**
- **Fault Address Analysis**: Provides instruction-level analysis of crash locations
- **Automatic Backtrace**: Embedded backtrace provides complete call stack information
- **Signal Type Differentiation**: Handles segmentation faults, floating-point errors, and user interrupts separately
- **Graceful Recovery**: REPL continues operation after user code errors

### 9. Memory Management and Variable State Preservation

Advanced memory management and variable tracking:

- **Session State Maintenance**: Maintains variable declarations during the current REPL session through decl_amalgama.hpp
- **Type-Aware Printing**: Generates type-specific printing functions for variable inspection
- **Cross-Library Variable Access**: Enables access to variables defined in previously loaded libraries within the same session
- **#return Command**: Combines expression evaluation with automatic result printing
- **Temporary State**: Variable state is not persisted between REPL sessions (future enhancement)

### 10. Advanced REPL Commands and Features

The system provides several sophisticated commands:

- **#eval**: Wraps expressions in functions for execution (not needed for declarations)
- **#return**: Evaluates expressions and prints results automatically
- **#includedir**: Adds include directories
- **#compilerdefine**: Adds preprocessor definitions
- **#lib**: Links additional libraries
- **#loadprebuilt**: Loads pre-compiled object files (.a, .o, .so) with automatic wrapper generation
- **#batch_eval**: Processes multiple files simultaneously

#### Intelligent Command Caching

The system implements automatic caching of compiled commands to avoid redundant compilation:

```cpp
// Internal cache mechanism
std::unordered_map<std::string, EvalResult> evalResults;

// When executing identical commands:
if (auto rerun = evalResults.find(line); rerun != evalResults.end()) {
    std::cout << "Rerunning compiled command" << std::endl;
    rerun->second.exec();  // Direct execution, no recompilation
    return true;
}
```

**Cache Behavior**:
- **First execution**: Compiles and caches the result
- **Subsequent identical inputs**: Directly executes cached compiled code
- **Performance impact**: Eliminates ~100-500ms compilation overhead for repeated commands
- **Memory efficient**: Stores function pointers, not duplicated libraries

**Example demonstrating cache:**
```cpp
>>> #return factorial(5)  // First time: compilation + execution
build time: 120ms
exec time: 15us
Type name: int value: 120

>>> #return factorial(5)  // Subsequent times: cached execution only
Rerunning compiled command
exec time: 12us
Type name: int value: 120
```

### 11. Bootstrap Extension Mechanism

Advanced extensibility through function pointer bootstrapping:

```cpp
extern int (*bootstrapProgram)(int argc, char **argv);
```

This mechanism enables users to:
- Assign custom main-like functions to the REPL
- Transfer control from REPL to user-defined programs
- Create self-modifying applications

### 12. Pre-built Library Integration (`#loadprebuilt`)

The `#loadprebuilt` command implements sophisticated integration of external compiled libraries into the REPL environment:

#### Symbol Extraction and Analysis
```cpp
std::vector<VarDecl> vars = getBuiltFileDecls(path);
// Executes: nm <file> | grep ' T ' to extract function symbols
// Creates VarDecl entries for each discovered function
```

The system uses the `nm` utility to extract all text symbols (functions) from the target library, creating internal representations that enable dynamic linking.

#### Automatic Format Conversion
```cpp
if (filename.ends_with(".a") || filename.ends_with(".o")) {
    std::string cmd = "g++ -Wl,--whole-archive " + path +
                      " -Wl,--no-whole-archive -shared -o " + library;
    system(cmd.c_str());
}
```

**Static Library Processing**: Automatically converts `.a` and `.o` files to shared libraries:
- `--whole-archive`: Forces inclusion of ALL symbols, not just referenced ones
- `--no-whole-archive`: Restores normal linking behavior
- Ensures all functions become available for dynamic loading

#### Function Wrapper Generation
```cpp
prepareFunctionWrapper(filename, vars, functions);
// Generates naked assembly trampolines for each function
```

For each discovered function, the system generates assembly-level wrappers:
```cpp
// Generated wrapper example:
extern "C" void *function_name_ptr = nullptr;

void __attribute__((naked)) function_name() {
    __asm__ __volatile__("jmp *%0" : : "r"(function_name_ptr));
}
```

#### Symbol Offset Resolution
```cpp
resolveSymbolOffsetsFromLibraryFile(functions);
// Maps function names to their memory offsets within the library
```

Uses `nm -D --defined-only <library>` to create a mapping between symbol names and their positions, enabling precise memory address calculation.

#### Dynamic Loading and Linking
```cpp
void *handle = dlopen(library.c_str(), RTLD_NOW | RTLD_GLOBAL);
fillWrapperPtrs(functions, handlewp, handle);
```

**Final Integration**:
- Loads the library using `dlopen` with immediate symbol resolution
- Updates all wrapper function pointers to reference actual library functions
- Makes functions callable as if they were defined within the REPL session

#### Integration Benefits

1. **Seamless Interface**: External functions appear as native REPL functions
2. **Hot-Swapping Support**: Maintains ability to replace implementations dynamically
3. **Performance**: Minimal overhead through naked function trampolines
4. **Compatibility**: Works with static archives, object files, and shared libraries
5. **Error Recovery**: Maintains REPL crash safety even with external code

#### Important: Function Declarations Required

**Critical Note**: Loading a library with `#loadprebuilt` makes functions **available for execution**, but to **call them directly** in the REPL, you must still provide their declarations. This can be done in two ways:

**Include Headers**
```cpp
>>> #loadprebuilt libmath.a
>>> #include <cmath>  // Provides declarations for sqrt, sin, cos, etc.
>>> double result = sqrt(16.0);  // Now callable
```

- **Educational Settings**: Excellent for learning systems programming concepts
- **Sandboxed Environments**: Consider containerization for untrusted code
- **Research Applications**: Valuable for compiler and runtime system research

### Limitations and Responsible Usage

* No sandboxing: Do not use with untrusted code.
* Not designed for production deployment (research/educational only).
* Memory for all loaded libraries remains allocated (see “Future Work”).

### Enhanced Safety Through Signal Handling:

1. **Controlled Crash Recovery**: Signal-to-exception conversion prevents REPL termination from user code crashes
2. **Detailed Error Information**: Hardware exception objects preserve fault addresses and signal information
3. **Automatic Debugging**: Embedded backtraces and assembly analysis provide immediate crash diagnosis

### Remaining Limitations:

1. **Memory Leaks**: Old libraries remain loaded in memory even after function replacement
2. **Symbol Pollution**: Global symbol namespace can become cluttered with repeated compilations
3. **Compilation Overhead**: Each evaluation requires full compilation cycle
4. **Complex Signal Interactions**: Advanced signal handling may interfere with user code signal usage
5. **Session Persistence**: Variable state is lost when REPL session ends

## Advanced Assembly and Linking Techniques

The project demonstrates several low-level systems programming concepts:

- **ELF Binary Analysis**: Uses tools like `nm` to extract symbol tables from compiled objects
- **Relocatable Code Generation**: Ensures all generated code can be loaded at runtime-determined addresses
- **Cross-Module Symbol Resolution**: Implements custom symbol resolution across dynamically loaded libraries
- **Hardware Exception Handling**: Integrates with signal handling for debugging information including assembly instruction analysis
- **Register State Preservation**: Careful assembly programming to maintain calling conventions
- **ABI Interception**: Hooks into C++ runtime for backtrace embedding

>>> printall
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Compilation Errors**
   ```
   Error: command failed with exit code 1
   ```
   - Check syntax of input code
   - Verify all includes are available
   - Use `#includedir` to add missing paths

2. **Symbol Resolution Failures**
   ```
   Cannot load symbol 'function_name'
   ```
   - Ensure function is declared with correct linkage
   - Check if precompiled headers need rebuilding
   - Verify library dependencies with `#lib`

3. **Segmentation Faults**
   ```
   Hardware exception: SEGV at: 0x...
   ```
   - Run with `-s` flag for detailed crash analysis
   - Check memory access patterns in user code
   - Review assembly output for debugging

#### Environment Setup

```bash
# Ensure required tools are available
which clang++     # Should point to Clang compiler
which addr2line   # For debugging support
which nm          # For symbol analysis
which gdb         # For instruction analysis

# Set up include paths if needed
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/local/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
```
