# Performance Verification Report

## Test Environment
- **Date**: August 31, 2025
- **System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, x86_64
- **CPU**: Azure VM (4 cores)
- **Build**: Release mode with optimizations
- **Compiler**: GNU C++ 13.3.0
- **LLVM**: 18.1.3

## Testing Methodology

1. **Startup Time**: Measured 5 runs of basic `help` command execution
2. **Compilation Time**: Measured 5 different C++ code patterns in batch mode  
3. **Memory Usage**: Used `/usr/bin/time -v` for comprehensive resource monitoring
4. **Sample Size**: Multiple test cases to ensure statistical validity

## Results Summary

### Performance Metrics (Actual vs Documented)

| Metric | Previously Documented | Measured Results | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Compilation Time** | 63ms average | **93ms average** | Environment-specific |
| **Startup Time** | 0.54s | **0.82s** | Environment-specific |
| **Peak Memory** | Not specified | **150MB** | New data |

### Detailed Compilation Times

Test cases measured:
1. `int x = 42;` → 91ms
2. `float y = 3.14f;` → 91ms  
3. `std::string s = "hello";` → 93ms
4. `#include <vector>` → 97ms
5. `std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};` → 93ms

**Statistics:**
- Average: 93.0ms
- Median: 93ms
- Range: 91-97ms (6ms variation)

### Memory Analysis

- **Peak Memory Usage**: 150,252 KB (~147MB)
- **Page Faults**: 2 (minimal disk I/O)
- **Context Switches**: ~997 (normal for compilation workload)

### Performance Characteristics

Current implementation demonstrates:
- **Compilation Time**: 93ms average (measured in Ubuntu 24.04, Release build)
- **Variability**: 91-97ms range (6ms variation, good consistency)
- **Pipeline**: Optimized parallel compilation architecture

## Root Cause Analysis

The discrepancy between documented and measured performance likely stems from:

1. **Environmental Differences**: Original measurements may have been on different hardware
2. **Test Methodology**: Different test cases or measurement approaches
3. **Build Configuration**: Possible differences in optimization flags or dependencies
4. **System Load**: Cloud VM environment vs dedicated hardware

## Actions Taken

✅ **Updated all documentation** to reflect accurate measured performance:
- README.md - Updated badges and performance claims
- docs/USER_GUIDE.md - Updated example timings
