# Performance Verification Report

## Test Environment
- **Date**: 2025-10-05
- **System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, x86_64
- **CPU**: Azure VM (4 cores)
- **Build**: Release mode with optimizations
- **Compiler**: GNU C++ 13.3.0 (as available on test machine)
- **LLVM**: 18.1.3 (used for AST dump and related tools)

## Testing Methodology

1. **Startup Time**: Measured 5 runs of basic `help` command execution
2. **Compilation Time**: Measured 5 different C++ code patterns in batch mode  
3. **Memory Usage**: Used `/usr/bin/time -v` for comprehensive resource monitoring
4. **Sample Size**: Multiple test cases to ensure statistical validity

## Results summary

### Performance metrics (measured on the test environment above)

| Metric | Measured (median/avg) | Notes |
|--------|----------------------:|-------|
| Compilation time (simple snippets) | ~93 ms (avg) | Measured on the test VM; workload and host affect results |
| Startup time (first run, warm caches) | ~0.82 s | Includes PCH generation on first run in this environment |
| Peak memory (compilation + process) | ~150 MB | Includes transient memory during compile

### Detailed Compilation Times

Test cases measured:
1. `int x = 42;` → 91ms
2. `float y = 3.14f;` → 91ms  
3. `std::string s = "hello";` → 93ms
4. `#include <vector>` → 97ms
5. `std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};` → 93ms

**Statistics (sample set):**
- Average: 93.0 ms
- Median: 93 ms
- Range: 91–97 ms

### Memory Analysis

- **Peak Memory Usage**: 150,252 KB (~147MB)
- **Page Faults**: 2 (minimal disk I/O)
- **Context Switches**: ~997 (normal for compilation workload)

### Performance characteristics (takeaways)

- The measured compilation times reflect simple snippets compiled on the test VM and should be used as a relative reference only.
- Variability is small for the measured cases (91–97 ms), but real projects and different hardware will show larger spread.
- The compilation pipeline uses parallelism; improvements in caching and symbol persistence are planned to reduce cold-start costs.

## Root Cause Analysis

The discrepancy between documented and measured performance likely stems from:

1. **Environmental Differences**: Original measurements may have been on different hardware
2. **Test Methodology**: Different test cases or measurement approaches
3. **Build Configuration**: Possible differences in optimization flags or dependencies
4. **System Load**: Cloud VM environment vs dedicated hardware

## Actions taken

- Updated documentation to reference measured results and point readers to this report for details. The `README.md` contains a concise summary; this file contains measured data for the specific test environment.

- Recommended next steps: expand the test matrix (different CPUs, SSD vs HDD, local hardware) and collect more sample sizes before claiming platform-independent targets.

## Conclusion

This verified dataset shows the system behavior on a specific test VM. The numbers are a snapshot and not guarantees. Use this report for comparative analysis and expand the testing matrix to obtain broader performance characterization.
