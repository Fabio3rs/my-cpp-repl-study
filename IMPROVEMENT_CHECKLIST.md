## üéØ Quick Wins (Week 1 Focus)

For immediate impact, prioritize these items:

1. **Extract `CompilerService` class** from `repl.cpp` lines 519-1080
2. **Replace global `linkLibraries`** with member variable
3. **Add basic unit tests** for extracted functionality  
4. **Implement `ScopedLibrary` RAII wrapper** for `dlopen`
5. **Create project structure** with proper directories (`src/`, `include/`, `tests/`)

These changes alone will reduce the monolith by ~500 lines and provide a foundation for further improvements.

## üìã Tracking Progress

Use this checklist format for tracking:
- [ ] **Not Started**
- [üîÑ] **In Progress** 
- [‚úÖ] **Complete**
- [‚ùå] **Blocked** (include reason)

Regular reviews should assess:
- Completion percentage per category
- Blocking issues and dependencies  
- Impact on code quality metrics
- Timeline adjustments needed

## ü§ù Contributing

When implementing improvements:

1. **Start with tests** - Write tests before implementation
2. **Small increments** - Make minimal changes per PR
3. **Document changes** - Update documentation as you go
4. **Measure impact** - Verify improvements with metrics
5. **Seek feedback** - Regular code reviews for complex changes

This systematic approach ensures steady progress toward a production-ready C++ REPL system.
