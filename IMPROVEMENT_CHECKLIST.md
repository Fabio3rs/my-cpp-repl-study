# C++ REPL v1.5-alpha - Release Roadmap and Current Status

## 📋 **v1.5-alpha Release Status**

**Current Release**: **v1.5-alpha** - Stable core functionality with simple completion
**Next Target**: **v2.0** - Advanced LSP integration and production features

The system has successfully evolved from a monolithic prototype to a modular, well-tested alpha release with comprehensive C++ REPL functionality.

### Current Metrics (v1.5-alpha)
| Metric | Before (Monolith) | v1.5-alpha | Achievement |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|
| Main REPL File | 2,119 lines | **1,463 lines** | **-656 lines (-31.0% reduction)** |
| Total System | 2,119 lines | **~7,500 lines** | **✅ Complete modular system** |
| Modular Code (src/) | 0 lines | **~1,900 lines** | **✅ Focused components** |
| Headers (include/) | 0 lines | **~1,350 lines** | **✅ Clean interfaces** |
| Main Program | N/A | **467 lines** | **✅ Batch mode + signal handling** |
| Test Coverage | Minimal | **5 test suites** | **✅ 118/118 tests passing (100%)** |
| Thread Safety | ❌ Global state | ✅ Synchronized | **✅ Complete thread safety** |
| Error Handling | ❌ Inconsistent | ✅ CompilerResult<T> | **✅ Modern error system** |
| Completion System | ❌ None | ✅ Simple readline | **✅ Basic working completion** |
| Signal Handling | ❌ None | ✅ SIGSEGV/SIGFPE/SIGINT | **✅ Crash-safe execution** |

### **System Constraints (POSIX/Linux Focus)**

🔧 **POSIX Compliance**: System designed for Linux/POSIX-compliant systems
🔧 **Global State**: dlopen/dlsym require global state (POSIX inner workings)  
🔧 **Shared Memory**: REPL shares memory with user code (security limitations acknowledged)
🔧 **Symbol Resolution**: Trampoline-based lazy loading with naked function optimization

### **Core REPL Functionality (Working)**

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Interactive REPL** | ✅ **Stable** | Line-by-line C++ execution with variable persistence |
# Improvement Checklist (v1.5 → v2.0)

This checklist contains the actionable items and known issues carried forward from the v1.5 release. It is intentionally concise: the README contains the project summary and high-level goals; this file lists items contributors can pick up.

## Known issues (short)

- Variable redefinition and include handling: test failure on include-heavy code paths. Priority: high.
- Memory growth during long REPL sessions: investigate and add targeted tests. Priority: medium.

## Short-term tasks (v2.0 P1)

- Integrate clangd/libclang for semantic completion and diagnostics (design available).
- Harden the CMake build and add CI jobs for Linux targets.
- Implement a simple persistent symbol cache to reduce cold-start cost.
- Improve error diagnostics to include code context where feasible.

## Medium-term tasks (v2.0 P2)

- Add basic multi-file support and improve library linking behavior.
- Provide initial debugging hooks (GDB/LLDB) for crash inspection.
- Prepare design and CI for cross-platform builds (Windows/macOS) — planning only.

## Notes

- Keep README.md as the public summary. Use these files for technical detail and tracking.
- Prefer small, testable PRs. Tag changes with `v2.0/p1` or `v2.0/p2` depending on scope.
- ✅ **Advanced hardware exception handling** converts signals to C++ exceptions with:
  - **Assembly instruction analysis** on crashes using objdump integration
  - **Stack trace generation** with symbol resolution via dladdr
  - **Library mapping** for shared library crash analysis
  - **Graceful session recovery** without terminating the REPL

### **Modular Architecture**
- ✅ **CompilerService** (941 lines): Complete compilation pipeline with modern error handling
- ✅ **SymbolResolver** (470 lines): Modularized existing trampoline-based symbol resolution
- ✅ **AstContext** (790 lines): Thread-safe AST analysis with enhanced usability
- ✅ **ExecutionEngine** (133 lines): Global state management respecting POSIX constraints
- ✅ **Command System** (268 lines): Plugin-style architecture with expanded command set
- ✅ **Utility Infrastructure** (1,058 lines): RAII patterns and modern C++ throughout
