# Context-Aware Autocompletion System

This directory documents the completion subsystem and provides guidance for integrating libclang with the existing Readline-based completion hooks.

Project files

- `clang_completion.hpp/.cpp` — core completion engine (libclang-backed when implemented).
- `readline_integration.hpp/.cpp` — thin bridge to register a completion callback with GNU Readline.
- `completion_demo.cpp` — a small demo showing how to wire the pieces together.

Design overview

1. ClangCompletion: uses libclang to extract semantic information and produce CompletionItem objects for the current cursor position.
     - getCompletions(partialCode, line, column)
     - updateReplContext(const ReplContext& context)
     - getDocumentation(const std::string& symbol)

2. ReadlineIntegration: registers a C-style callback with Readline and forwards queries to the completion engine.

3. ReplContext: a compact container of REPL state (includes, declared variables and functions, active code snapshot) used to scope completion queries.

Status and tasks

- Mock implementation present for experimentation. The mock is useful to validate the integration points and UI behavior.
- Remaining tasks to enable full semantic completion:
    1) Integrate libclang and parse translation units.
    2) Implement a context-aware completion provider that consumes ReplContext.
    3) Add a persistent cache and smart invalidation to reduce latency.

Build and demo

Demo build (no libclang):

    g++ -std=c++20 -I./include examples/completion_demo.cpp src/completion/clang_completion.cpp src/completion/readline_integration.cpp -lreadline -o completion_demo

Run:

    ./completion_demo

Real implementation (with libclang):

    sudo apt-get install libclang-dev
    # Add pkg-config or find_package calls for libclang in CMakeLists.txt and link the target

Performance considerations

- Use lazy parsing and caching to keep completion latency low.
- Implement smart invalidation so small edits don't force re-parsing entire translation units.
- Consider a background worker to build and update translation unit snapshots while the REPL is idle.

Integration points with existing REPL

1. replState.varsNames -> ReplContext.variableDeclarations
2. current includes -> ReplContext.currentIncludes
3. repl-defined functions -> ReplContext.functionDeclarations
4. existing AST context -> used for type information and symbol resolution

Next steps

- Replace mocks with libclang-backed implementation when libclang is available.
- Add unit tests for the completion engine and Readline integration callbacks.
- Track remaining work in `IMPROVEMENT_CHECKLIST.md` and by tagging issues with `v2.0` milestones.
